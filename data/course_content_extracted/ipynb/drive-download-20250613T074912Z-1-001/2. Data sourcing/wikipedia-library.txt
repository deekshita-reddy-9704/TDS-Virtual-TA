This is a self-explanatory short tutorial on using the `wikipedia` library to extract information from Wikipedia.

!pip install wikipedia
import wikipedia as wk

print(wk.search("IIT Madras"))

print(wk.search("IIT Madras", results=2))

print(wk.summary("Indian Institutes of Technology"))

print(wk.summary("Indian Institutes of Technology", sentences=2))

full_page = wk.page("Indian Institutes of Technology")

print(full_page.content)

print(full_page.url)

print(full_page.references)

print(full_page.title)

print(full_page.images)

print(full_page.images[0])

# Extract html code of wikipedia page based on any search text
html = wk.page("Indian Institutes of Technology").html().encode("UTF-8")

import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_html(html)[1]

df
