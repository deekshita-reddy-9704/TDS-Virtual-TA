AI recommended column for analysis: To determine the best columns for visualization in a histogram and scatter plot, it's important to select numeric columns that reveal meaningful distributions or relationships.

1. **Histogram Recommendation**:
   - **`original_publication_year`**: This column can provide insights into the distribution of the books published over the decades or years, reflecting trends in literature. You can visualize how many books were released in a particular year, showing peaks during certain periods.

2. **Scatter Plot Recommendation**:
   - **`books_count`**: Pair it with **`original_publication_year`** to see if there's a correlation between the number of books and their publication year. This scatter plot can illustrate if more recent years (or decades) have significantly more books published or if there's a consistent count over the years.

These two visualizations, one focusing on the distribution of publication years and the other on the relationship between book counts and publication years, should provide valuable insights into the dataset.
